# Lab 2: Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

### Search historical tweets using locational information (`twsearch.ipynb` Exercise)


#### Introduction

In recent news, Florida Govenor Ron DeSantis is proposing legislation to permanently ban covid-related mandates. This legislation means businesses and schools can no longer have vaccine and masks requirements. In addition, this would prohibit firing employees who do not follow covid-related protocals. I would like to research how different places reacted to this recent legislation proposal and how they presently feel about covid-related mandates. I am researching this topic because it will help me understand more about people's perceptions about this aspect of the pandemic after almost three years. I will search tweets from three different locations with the same set of search parameters.  I chose to search for all tweets with the words "covid mandates" from January 17th, 2023 to January 18th, 2023. The three locations I chose were:
 - Capitol Hill, Seattle with a 72-mile radius because it is where I reside in. Therefore, I want to know the how my city feels about covid mandates. 
  - King County, Texas with a 210-mile radius because in 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned any COVID-19 vaccine mandate, so I want to know the how cities in Texas feel about covid mandates.  
  - Miami, Florida with a 66-mile radius because Gov. DeSantis is the governor of Florida, so I want to know the how a popular tourist-city in Florida feels about covid mandates.

**Compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds with possible reasons**



**Anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you**

I surprised to see the word count of "DeSantis" to be prevalent in all of the word clouds. Although, Gov. DeSantis pushes to ban mandates only in Florida, other states still care about his legistlative actions as shown through the high number of tweets in other states. In additon, the "DeSantis"  word count for Texas is greater than Florida.
