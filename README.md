## Katherine Poch

### Harvest real-time geo-tagged tweets using a API-based crawler 
**`twstream.ipynb` Exercise**


**Introduction**
Introduce your comparison of more places or two time periods. Why do you want to make this comparison?

**2 Maps**

1. describe the parameters you have used for search
2.  compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different geospatial patterns on the map
3. anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise.


### Search historical tweets using locational information
**`twsearch.ipynb` Exercise**

 in least three different places with the same set of search parameters (e.g., search terms, date, etc.). 

**Introduction**
introduce your research design. 
What topic you have chosen, 
how you pick the search terms as well as the search parameters.

In recent news, FLorida Govenor Ron DeSantis is proposing legislation to permanently ban covid-related mandates. This legislation means businesses and schools can no longer have vaccine and masks requirements. In addition, this would prohibit firing employees who do not follow covid-related protocals. I would like to research how different places reacted to this recent legislation proposal and how they presently feel about covid-related mandates. I will search tweets from three different locations with the same set of search parameters. I chose to search for all tweets with the words "covid mandates" from January 17th, 2023 to January 18th, 2023. The three locations I chose were:
 - Capitol Hill, Seattle with a 72-mile radius
  - King County, Texas with a 210-mile radius
  - Miami, Florida with a 66-mile radius
