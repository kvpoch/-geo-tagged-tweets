# Lab 2: Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

### Search historical tweets using locational information (`twsearch.ipynb` Exercise)


#### Introduction

In recent news, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is proposing legislation to permanently ban covid-related mandates. This legislation means businesses and schools can no longer have vaccine and masks requirements. In addition, this would prohibit firing employees who do not follow covid-related protocols. I would like to research how different places reacted to this recent legislation proposal and how they presently feel about covid-related mandates. I am researching this topic because it will help me understand more about people's perceptions about this aspect of the pandemic after almost three years. I will search tweets from three different locations with the same set of search parameters.  I chose to search for all tweets with the words "covid mandates" from January 17th, 2023 to January 18th, 2023. The three locations I chose were:
 - Capitol Hill, Seattle with a 72-mile radius because it is where I reside in. Therefore, I want to know the how my city feels about covid mandates. 
  - King County, Texas with a 210-mile radius because in 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned any COVID-19 vaccine mandate, so I want to know the how cities in Texas feel about covid mandates.  
  - Miami, Florida with a 66-mile radius because Gov. DeSantis is the governor of Florida, so I want to know the how a popular tourist-city in Florida feels about covid mandates.  
 

 #### Word Clouds


**Florida Word Cloud**

**Compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds with possible reasons**

Since I used the phrase "covid mandates" to filter the tweets, the words "covid" and "mandates" are the most prevalent in all word clouds. All word clouds have the words "Ban", "DeSantis", "Mask", "Permanent", and "Vaccine". These words all covid-related terms and related to Gov. DeSantis' legislation. The word count of "Vaccine" is the largest in Florida possibly because of DeSantis' legislation for banning vaccine requirements. Florida has small word counts of the words: "dangerous", "injustice" and "against", therefore this might suggest some people think banning covid mandates is an unsafe choice. The Washington word cloud has the largest word count for "Death". Although, the Texas word cloud has small word counts for the words "dies" and "deaths". This might suggest Washington is more concerned for covid-related deaths than other states. The Washington word cloud has words like "CDC" and "testing", unlike the other word clouds. Texas is the only word cloud with a decent word count for the word "God". This might suggest religion has been intertwined into the beliefs about Covid mandates for people in Texas. 



**Anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you**

I surprised to see the word count of "DeSantis" to be prevalent in all of the word clouds. Although, Gov. DeSantis pushes to ban mandates only in Florida, other states still care about his legislative actions as shown through the high number of tweets in other states. In addition, the "DeSantis"  word count for Texas is greater than Florida. 


**How your research could be improved in the future**
In the future, I would have more search parameters like "mandate", "covid restrictions", "covid-19" and more. I would also include a larger date range. For example, 01-17-2023 to 01-22-2023.
